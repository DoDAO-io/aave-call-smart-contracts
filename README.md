# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
# To compile
npx hardhat compile
# To test
npx hardhat test
# To run-node
npx hardhat node
# to deploy:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
# goerli:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network goerli
# scroll:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network scroll
# hardhat:
npx hardhat node
```
